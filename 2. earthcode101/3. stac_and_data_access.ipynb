    "## What is STAC\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification was designed to establish a standard, unified language to talk about geospatial data, allowing it to be more easily searchable and queryable.\n",
    "\n",
    "STAC has been designed to be simple, flexible, and extensible. STAC is a network of JSON files that reference other JSON files, with each JSON file adhering to a specific core specification depending on which STAC component it is describing. This core JSON format can also be customized to fit differing needs, making the STAC specification highly flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the STAC specification seems 'light', that is because it is light-- by design. Through this flexibility, different domains and tools can easily utilize the STAC specification and make it their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Extensions section of the spec is where the community collaborates on more detail about specific data types and new functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a SpatioTemporal Asset\n",
    "\n",
    "A SpatioTemporal Asset is any file that represents information about the Earth captured in a certain place and at a particular time. Examples include spatiotemporal data derived from imagery (from satellites, airplanes, and drones), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), point clouds (from LiDAR, structure from motion, etc.), data cubes, or full-motion video, or vector files, etc . The key is that the GeoJSON is not the actual 'thing', but instead references files and serves as an index to the STAC Assets.\n",

    "# STAC Components\n",
    "There are three component specifications that together make up the core SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification. These components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Item - A STAC Item is the foundational building block of STAC. It is a GeoJSON feature supplemented with additional metadata that enables clients to traverse through catalogs. Since an item is a GeoJSON, it can be easily read by any modern GIS or geospatial library. One item can describe one or more SpatioTemporal Asset(s). For example, a common practice of using STAC for imagery is that each band in a scene is its own STAC Asset and there is one STAC Item to represent all the bands in a single scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Catalog - A Catalog is usually the starting point for navigating a STAC. A catalog.json file contains links to some combination of other STAC Catalogs, Collections, and/or Items. We can think of it like a directory tree on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collection - A STAC Collection builds upon the STAC Catalog specification to include additional metadata about a set of items that exist as part of the collection. It extends the parent catalog by adding additional fields to enable the description of information like the spatial and temporal extent of the data, the license, keywords, providers, etc. Therefore, it can easily be extended for additional collection-level metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component can be used alone, but they work best in concert with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "![stac](../static/stacsetup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A STAC Item represents one or more spatiotemporal assets as GeoJSON so that it can be easily searched. The STAC Catalog specification provides structural elements to group STAC Items and Collections. STAC Collections are catalogs that add more required metadata and describe a group of related items. Now, let's dive into each one of these components a bit more in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The STAC API specification builds on top of that core and allows us to do dynamic queries over our collections."

    "\n",
    "As described in **https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/** in this case the STAC catalog contains a collection for each Zarr store and there are collection-level assets that point to the location of the Zarr store. There are no items at all in this setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario any STAC metadata exists purely for discovery and cannot be used for filtering or subsetting (see Future Work for more on that). To search the STAC catalog to find collections of interest you will use the Collection Search API Extension. Depending on the level of metadata that has been provided in the STAC catalog you can search by the name of the collection and possibly by the variables – exposed via the Data Cube Extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read straight to xarray\n",
    "For a collection of interest, the best approach for accessing the data is to construct the lazily-loaded data cube in xarray (or an xarray.DataTree if the Zarr store has more than one group) and filter from there.\n",

    "In the next step we will do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Search for multiple cloudless sentinel-2 satellite images within a month of our pre-fire (week_before) date. The STAC API allows us to do a couple of things in a simple API call:\n",
    "- We can define an arrea of interest (bbox) and search for items that cover this region\n",
    "- We can subset for the time of interest as well (datetime)\n",
    "- We can define custom querries over implemented STAC extensions. For example, the Sentinel STAC collection we are querrying implements the eo STAC extension, and defines cloud_cover - this allows us to search for quality assets with minimal cloudy pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return the relevant STAC items - which contain assets that point to our data of interest. We now need to load this data into a dataarray to start analysing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Note that in the above step, we only have items that point to some data - this data can be tiff, zarr, netcdf, COG, or other SpatioTemporal asset data. In our case, the element84 endpoint points to the data collection of  *https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs/* - the format of our data is cloud-optimized GeoTiff. A cloud-friendly format such as this enables us cloud-native access patterns, such as easily fetching only our area of interest (as opposed to several tiff files and manually subsetting them after downloading).\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as odc-stac integrate with STAC standards and allow us to load data as well as leveraging the cloud-optimised formats. For example, in the cell below we define how we want to transform/load our data by:\n",
    "- Passing the STAC item (or multiple items) we want to load\n",
    "- defining a particular chunk size (the passed {} asks for the data to be automatically chunked as it is originally);\n",
    "- We can request only the spectral bands of interest, in this case nir and swir22, to reduce the amount of data that we fetch.\n",
    "- We can define a resolution to retrieve the data at, note that this will also resample automatically. For example the nir band data has a 10m resolution, but the swir22 - 20m resolution.\n",
    "- There are multiple other options as well, such as defining in which projection we want our data in. More information can be found at: https://odc-stac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/odc.stac.load.html\n"

    "> **Note:** The above STAC API query might return assets that intersect the region but do not fully cover it. I.e. if we fetched only one asset for each period with the above query they could potentially point to different regions (as there would be data missing). Although not relevant in this example, as all assets from both pre and after overlap, this will be a problem if not checked (as you'd be analysing different regions). In this example we visually inspect the overlap between assets and further take the mean of all the assets to get better quality pixels across time. Rerun the same example with cloud_cover = 0.2 to see where you might get some problem code!"
