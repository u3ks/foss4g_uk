    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large data files or collections, it's often impossible to load all the data you want to analyze into a single computer's RAM at once. This is a situation where the Pangeo ecosystem can help you a lot. Xarray offers the possibility to work lazily on data __chunks__, which means pieces of an entire dataset. By reading a dataset in __chunks__ we can process our data piece by piece on a single computer and even on a distributed computing cluster using Dask (Cloud or HPC for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "How we will process these 'chunks' in a parallel environment will be discussed in [dask_introduction](./dask_introduction.ipynb). The concept of __chunk__ will be explained here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we process our data piece by piece, it's easier to have our input or ouput data also saved in __chunks__. [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the reference library in the Pangeo ecosystem to save our Xarray multidimentional datasets in __chunks__.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is not the only file format which uses __chunk__. [kerchunk library](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/) for example builds a virtual __chunked__ dataset based on NetCDF files, and optimizes the access and analysis of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",

    "In this workshop, we will be using the [SeasFire Data Cube](https://opensciencedata.esa.int/products/seasfire-cube/collection) published to the EarthCODE Open Science Catalog\n",

    "## What is a __chunk__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look carefully at our dataset, each Data Variable is a `ndarray` (or `dask.array` if you have a dask client instantiated) with a chunk size of `(966, 180, 360)`. So basically accessing one data variable would load arrays of dimensions `(966, 180, 360)` into the computer's RAM. You can see this information and more details by clicking the icon as indicated in the image below.\n",
