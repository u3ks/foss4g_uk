# EDC Pangeo Cloud Platform

## About the Environment: Introducing the EDC Pangeo Cloud Platform

You can now work with the Pangeo stack on the EDC EOxHub!

**What is Pangeo?**

Pangeo is a community-driven open-source ecosystem designed for scalable, Pythonic big data analysis. It brings a suite of powerful libraries that make working with large Earth observation and climate datasets easier and more interactive.

**Key Tools in Pangeo** that you will learn about today:
- **Xarray**: Handles multi-dimensional labeled arrays (like NetCDF), with intuitive syntax that feels natural for Python users.
- **STAC**: Simplifies discovery and access to large Earth observation datasets with a consistent, JSON-based catalog standard.
- **Dask**: Enables parallel and distributed computing, scaling analysis from laptops to powerful cloud clusters.
- **Zarr**: Provides efficient, cloud-native storage for chunked and compressed data, perfect for massive datasets.
- **Jupyter**: Delivers an interactive, shareable environment for building and sharing workflows.

These tools work together embracing the Pythonic way of data science and enabling intuitive exploration and high-performance analysis in the cloud.


**Euro Data Cube (EDC)**  
A cloud platform for Earth observation data access and analysis, featuring a rich data catalog (Sentinel, Landsat, Copernicus, etc.), cloud-native analytics, and collaborative sharing tools for environmental, disaster, and climate applications. See more details at: [eurodatacube.com](https://eurodatacube.com)


**EDC EOxHub Workspace Offering**  
The EDC EOxHub Workspaces provide managed JupyterLab environments with curated images for EO projects. They offer customizable computing resources, persistent storage, and fast network connections. Users can run notebooks and applications, with fair use limits based on resource consumption.

:::{hint} Network of Resources Sponsorship!

NoR provides non-commercial and commercial users with a unique environment to discover European cloud services and their estimate costs for Earth Observation exploitation. ESA offers sponsorship to eligible entities to cover the costs of trying out the various services.
