*Organisers and expected contributors: Deyan Samardzhiev (Lampata), Anne Fouilloux (Simula Research Laboratory), Tina Odaka (IFREMER), Anca Anghelea (ESA), Ewelina Agnieszka Dobrowolska (Serco), Chandra Taposeea-Fisher (Telespazio UK), Garin Smith (Telespazio UK)*

EarthCODE (https://earthcode.esa.int/) proactively promotes open science and innovation by providing a federated ecosystem of FAIR and Open Science tools and platforms. EarthCODE integrates EO (Earth Observation) cloud-native platforms for big data analytics, through a federated ecosystem. It enables scalable data management, access, processing, and visualization of datasets as well as reusable data products and workflows.

This tutorial introduces participants to EarthCODE's capabilities, guiding them from finding, accessing and accessing EO datasets and workflows to publishing reproducible experiments. Through a hands-on demonstration with a integrated platform, Pangeo, this workshop will equip participants with the tools and knowledge to use EarthCODE for their own projects and (for ESA funded projects) contribute to the future of open science.

During this 3-hour hands-on workshop, participants will:
1. Understand EarthCODE’s role in advancing FAIR and Open Science,
2. Learn how to find, access, interoperate and reuse data and workflows on EarthCODE,
3. Execute analysis pipelines using Pangeo on EDC, and;
4. Publish reusable data and experiments to EarthCODE

This session is ideal for EO researchers, data scientists, and application developers seeking to benefit from and contribute to open science. At the end of the workshop, we will take time for discussion and feedback on how to make EarthCODE better for the community.
